# Wanyu Zhao 

I am an undergraduate researcher at [School of Software, Shandong University](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm), where I received the B. Eng. degree in 2022. I'm also a research intern at [Systems Platform Research Group (PlatformX)](https://platformxlab.github.io/), UIUC.

My research interests lie in computer systems, machine learning and the intersection between the two areas. My goal is to build practical and efficient systems (for machine learning and other emerging large-scale workloads).

## About Me

I was born in [Jilin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin), China.

I love movies and dance (Hiphop and Chinese folk dance).

My [twin sister](https://WanbingZhao.github.io) works on quantum computing and we both like to stay up late (late night discussions on the bed) .
