# Wanyu Zhao 

I am a second-year PhD at [UIUC CS](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) working with Prof. [Charith Mendis](https://charithmendis.com/).

My research interests lie in computer systems, machine learning, and the intersection between the two areas. My goal is to build practical and efficient systems (for machine learning and other emerging large-scale workloads). I'm also interested in applying Machine Learning to System Design.

## Misc
I've been lucky to work with Prof. [Jian Huang](https://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu/) at UIUC and Prof. [Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/) at Rice University during my undergrad:

- **Learning-Based Software-Defined Flash Infrastructure**
  
  Deploy reinforcement learning in SDF management to adapt to dynamically changing storage states and workload patterns.

- **Distributed Matrix Completion**

  Learn a rank-r matrix by learning lower rank matrices, distributedly.

I like coding and I'm committed to open source. Some of my past projects include: [ExAllTrue](https://exalltrue.github.io/eedc4/) (won the second place in the financial track of [DeeCamp 2021](https://deecamp.com/#/home)), [Rapq](https://github.com/wy-go/Rapq), [MazeGenerator](https://github.com/wy-go/MazeGenerator), and [ClassChat](https://github.com/wy-go/ClassChat).

  

## About Me

- I was born in [Jilin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin), China.

- I love music. I am an amateur dancer (Hiphop, Chinese folk dance, Latin, Ballet). I also play some Chinese traditional musical instruments.

- My [twin sister](https://WanbingZhao.github.io) works on quantum computing.
