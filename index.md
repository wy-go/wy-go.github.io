# Guanxi Jiang

Currently, I am a senior year undergraduate student in a joint programme between University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and University of Glasgow (UoG). 

My research interests lie in big data, neuromorphic computing and machine learning, which enable me to possess state-of-the-art technologies to improve the world.
