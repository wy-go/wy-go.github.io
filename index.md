# Wanyu Zhao 

I am a second-year PhD at [UIUC CS](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), advised by Prof. [Brighten Godfrey](https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/).  I’ve also had the privilege of working with Prof. [Charith Mendis](https://charithmendis.com/).

My research interests lie in computer systems, machine learning, and the intersection between the two areas. I've built practical and efficient systems for machine learning (Sys4ML). My recent research focuses on applying machine learning to systems design (ML4Sys).

I’m excited about opportunities where ML not only outperforms traditional heuristics but also unlocks system designs once unimaginable. From advancing ML techniques--such as explainability and eﬃciency--to designing next-generation system architecture integrating ML, I hope ML advancements will drive continuous progress in computer systems, much like Moore’s Law fueled decades of progress.

I'm part of [LDOS](https://ldos.utexas.edu/), where we are building the next-generation Machine Learning-based Operating System to drive computing infrastructure toward high efficiency and performance.

## Misc
I've been lucky to work with Prof. [Jian Huang](https://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu/) on learning-based software-defined flash infrastructure at UIUC and Prof. [Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/) on distributed matrix completion at Rice University during my undergrad.

I like coding and I'm committed to open source. Some of my past projects include: [ExAllTrue](https://exalltrue.github.io/eedc4/) (won the second place in the financial track of [DeeCamp 2021](https://deecamp.com/#/home)), [Rapq](https://github.com/wy-go/Rapq), [MazeGenerator](https://github.com/wy-go/MazeGenerator), and [ClassChat](https://github.com/wy-go/ClassChat).

  

## About Me

- I love music. I am an amateur dancer (Hiphop, Chinese folk dance, Latin, Ballet). I also play some Chinese traditional musical instruments.

- My [twin sister](https://WanbingZhao.github.io) works on quantum information theory.
