# Guanxi Jiang

Currently, I am a senior year undergraduate student in a joint programme between University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and University of Glasgow (UoG). 

My research interests lie in big data, neuromorphic computing and machine learning, which enable me to possess state-of-the-art technologies to improve the world.

## Project
  
- [Smart Rover]() 

  Designed and developed a smart rover which can follow dedicated paths, cross ramps and bridges, identify colors and move correspondingly, transmit messages to laptops and finally find the arch to stop.
  
- [RISC CPU]() 

  Designed a 16-bit CPU which can complete operations including ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, CMP, ACC, JMP, MOV, LDR and STR following FPGA design flow by Verilog on Vivado.


## Research

- Human Activity Recognition System Based on HNN, UESTC

  Designed a real-time and power-efficient embedded system to detect activities including Fall, Stand Up, Sit Down, Under and Walk by using Hopfield neuromorphic computing.
