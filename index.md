# Wanyu Zhao 

I am an undergraduate researcher at Shandong University, where I received the B. Eng. degree in 2022.

My research interests lie in computer systems, machine learning and the intersection between the two areas. My goal is to build practical and efficient systems (for machine learning and other emerging large-scale workloads).

I am applying for 23Fall PhD, thank you for reaching out!

## News
- [Feb. 2023] Just finished my research intern at [PlatformX@UIUC](https://platformxlab.github.io/)!

## Research 

- **Learning-Based Software-Defined Flash Infrastructure**
  
  Deploy reinforcement learning in SDF management to adapt to dynamically changing storage states and workload patterns.

- **Distributed Matrix Completion**

  Learn a rank-r matrix by learning lower rank matrices, distributedly.

- **Adaptive Gradient Communication**

  Adaptively compress gradient for distributed training considering different learning periods, bandwidth conditions and tensor/layer.


## Misc
I like coding and I'm committed to open source. Here are some of my projects.

- [ExAllTrue](https://exalltrue.github.io/eedc4/)
  
  ExAllTrue is our demo for Chinese financial document event extraction model in [DeeCamp 2021](https://deecamp.com/#/home). We won the second place in the financial track.


- [Rapq](https://github.com/wy-go/Rapq)

  Rapq is a search engine for finding the applications you want, including mobile apps, PC apps and online apps.


- [MazeGenerator](https://github.com/wy-go/MazeGenerator)

  MazeGenerator randomly generates a maze of specified size implemented by union-find.
  
  
- [ClassChat](https://github.com/wy-go/ClassChat)

  An affair management system for university classes (PC) with basic functions such as instant messaging (private chat and group chat), class announcements, and authority management.

  

## About Me

- I was born in [Jilin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin), China.

- I love movies, dance (Hiphop and [Chinese folk dance](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV153411w7XD?p=8&vd_source=b9661ae60934cbd7513d5fad3016c0c0)), and some Chinese traditional musical instruments.

- My [twin sister](https://WanbingZhao.github.io) works on quantum computing.

- At SDU, I was one of [ICPC team](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wy-go/wy-go.github.io/main/shandong-icpc19.jpg) and [High-performance Computing and Big Data Processing Group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wy-go/wy-go.github.io/main/sdu-hpc22.JPG).
