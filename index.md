# Wanyu Zhao 

I am a second-year PhD at [UIUC CS](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) working with Prof. [Charith Mendis](https://charithmendis.com/).

My research interests lie in computer systems, machine learning, and the intersection between the two areas. My goal is to build practical and efficient systems (for machine learning and other emerging large-scale workloads). I'm also interested in applying Machine Learning to System Design.


## News
- [Oct. 2024] I gave a [tutorial on efficient training of temporal graph neural networks](https://wjerry5.github.io/cikm2024-tutorial/) at [CIKM24](https://cikm2024.org/).
- [Mar. 2024] I gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=871k93Kolrg) on TGLite in [Temporal Graph Learning Reading Group](https://cikm2024.org/).
- [Apr. 2024] We released the [TGLite](https://charithmendis.com/assets/pdf/asplos24-tglite.pdf) framework for programming temporal GNNs. Check out its [code](https://github.com/ADAPT-uiuc/tglite) and [documentation](https://tglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- [Aug. 2023] Join UIUC!

## Misc
I've been lucky to work with Prof. [Jian Huang](https://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu/) at UIUC and Prof. [Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/) at Rice University during undergrad:

- **Learning-Based Software-Defined Flash Infrastructure**
  
  Deploy reinforcement learning in SDF management to adapt to dynamically changing storage states and workload patterns.

- **Distributed Matrix Completion**

  Learn a rank-r matrix by learning lower rank matrices, distributedly.

I like coding and I'm committed to open source. Some of my past projects include: [ExAllTrue](https://exalltrue.github.io/eedc4/): a demo for Chinese financial document event extraction in [DeeCamp 2021](https://deecamp.com/#/home) (won the second place in the financial track); [Rapq](https://github.com/wy-go/Rapq): a search engine for finding the applications you want, including mobile apps, PC apps, and online apps; [MazeGenerator](https://github.com/wy-go/MazeGenerator): a maze generator; [ClassChat](https://github.com/wy-go/ClassChat): an affair management system for university classes (PC) with basic functions such as instant messaging (private chat and group chat), class announcements, and authority management.

  

## About Me

- I was born in [Jilin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin), China.

- I love music. I am an amateur dancer (Hiphop, Chinese folk dance, Latin, Ballet). I also play some Chinese traditional musical instruments.

- My [twin sister](https://WanbingZhao.github.io) works on quantum computing.
