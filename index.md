# Wanyu Zhao 

I am an undergraduate researcher at [School of Software, Shandong University](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm), where I received the B. Eng. degree in 2022. I'm also a research intern at [Systems Platform Research Group (PlatformX)](https://platformxlab.github.io/), UIUC.

My research interests lie in computer systems, machine learning and the intersection between the two areas. My goal is to build practical and efficient systems (for machine learning and other emerging large-scale workloads).


## Research 

- **Learning-Based Software-Defined Flash Infrastructure**



- **Distributed Matrix Completion**

  Learn a rank-r matrix by learning lower rank matrices, distributedly.

- **Adaptive Gradient Communication**

  Adaptively compress gradient for distributed training considering different learning periods, bandwidth conditions and tensor/layer.


## Misc
I like coding and I'm committed to open source. Here are some of my projects.

- [ExAllTrue](https://exalltrue.github.io/eedc4/)
  
  ExAllTrue is our demo for Chinese financial document event extraction model in [DeeCamp 2021](https://deecamp.com/#/home). We won the second place in the financial track.
  

- [Papera](https://github.com/paperadar)

  Papera is an all-in-one paper reading open source software which I worked on in Microsoft Elite Class.


- [Rapq](https://github.com/wy-go/Rapq)

  Rapq is a search engine for finding the applications you want, including mobile apps, PC apps and online apps.


- [MazeGenerator](https://github.com/wy-go/MazeGenerator)

  MazeGenerator randomly generates a maze of specified size implemented by union-find.
  
  
- [ClassChat](https://github.com/wy-go/ClassChat)

  An affair management system for university classes (PC) with basic functions such as instant messaging (private chat and group chat), class announcements, and authority management.

  

## About Me

- I was born in [Jilin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin), China.

- I love movies and dance (Hiphop and [Chinese folk dance](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV153411w7XD?p=8&vd_source=b9661ae60934cbd7513d5fad3016c0c0)).

- My [twin sister](https://WanbingZhao.github.io) works on quantum computing and we both like to stay up late (late night discussions on the bed) .

- At SDU, I was a one of [ICPC team](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wy-go/wy-go.github.io/main/shandong-icpc19.jpg) and [High-performance Computing and Big Data Processing Group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wy-go/wy-go.github.io/main/sdu-hpc22.JPG).
